# 🚗 Krutanic Solutions Car Price Prediction Model
## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to predict the resale price of used cars using machine learning techniques—supporting smarter pricing strategies for automotive platforms and dealerships.

## 💡 Key Highlights
Domain: Automotive Analytics

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest

Focus Areas: Feature engineering, model tuning, business relevance

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Used car pricing is influenced by multiple factors—brand, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. Manual pricing often leads to inconsistencies and undervaluation. This model automates price estimation with data-driven accuracy.

## ⚙️ Methodology
Conducted EDA to understand pricing trends and feature distributions

Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables

Trained regression models and optimized hyperparameters for performance

Evaluated using metrics like R² score, MAE, and RMSE

## 📊 Results & Insights
Random Forest outperformed baseline models with strong predictive accuracy

Identified key price drivers: mileage, brand, fuel type

Proposed integration into resale platforms for real-time valuation

## 🌱 Future Scope
Incorporate regional pricing trends and seasonal demand factors

Add visual dashboards for dealer-side decision support

Explore deployment via web app or API for commercial use
