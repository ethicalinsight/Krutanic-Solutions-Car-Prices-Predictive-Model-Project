# 🧠 Krutanic Solutions Internship Projects

This repository highlights the core projects completed during my internship at **Krutanic Solutions** as a Data Science Intern. The work focused on applying analytical techniques to real-world datasets, building scalable solutions, and delivering insights through clean code and compelling visuals.

## 🔍 Highlights
- Performed data cleaning and transformation to prepare datasets for analysis
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, outliers, and correlations
- Built interactive dashboards using Power BI and Python to communicate insights effectively
- Applied statistical methods and machine learning models for predictive analysis
- Automated data workflows and implemented reusable scripts for efficiency
- Documented findings and presented results in stakeholder-friendly formats

Each project reflects a blend of technical precision, ethical framing, and practical impact—aligned with Krutanic’s mission to deliver data-driven solutions across industries.The description of each project, which was worked upon during the internship, is as follows:-


# 1. 🚗 Krutanic Solutions Car Price Prediction Model
## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to predict the resale price of used cars using machine learning techniques—supporting smarter pricing strategies for automotive platforms and dealerships.

## 💡 Key Highlights
Domain: Automotive Analytics

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest

Focus Areas: Feature engineering, model tuning, business relevance

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Used car pricing is influenced by multiple factors—brand, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. Manual pricing often leads to inconsistencies and undervaluation. This model automates price estimation with data-driven accuracy.

## ⚙️ Methodology
Conducted EDA to understand pricing trends and feature distributions

Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables

Trained regression models and optimized hyperparameters for performance

Evaluated using metrics like R² score, MAE, and RMSE

## 📊 Results & Insights
Random Forest outperformed baseline models with strong predictive accuracy

Identified key price drivers: mileage, brand, fuel type

Proposed integration into resale platforms for real-time valuation

## 🌱 Future Scope
Incorporate regional pricing trends and seasonal demand factors

Add visual dashboards for dealer-side decision support

Explore deployment via web app or API for commercial use

# 2. 🫁 Krutanic Solutions Lung Cancer Predictive Model
## 🔍 Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict lung cancer risk using clinical and behavioral indicators—empowering early screening and data-driven healthcare decisions.

## 💡 Key Highlights
Domain: Healthcare Analytics

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

Models Used: Random Forest, SVM

Accuracy Achieved: Approximately 92%

Focus Areas: Ethical modeling, feature interpretability, stakeholder-ready insights

## 🧠 What It Solves
Lung cancer often goes undetected until advanced stages. This model identifies high-risk profiles based on accessible data—supporting proactive intervention and scalable screening tools.

## ⚙️ Methodology
Performed EDA to uncover symptom patterns and demographic risk factors

Engineered features for smoking intensity, fatigue clustering, and genetic predisposition

Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers with a focus on recall and ROC-AUC

Prioritized ethical framing to avoid overfitting and misclassification risks

## 📊 Impact & Integration
Designed for potential integration into Krutanic’s digital health platform, enabling community-level screening and clinical decision support. Visualizations and model outputs are tailored for non-technical stakeholders.

## 🌱 Future Scope
Expand dataset with environmental and socioeconomic variables

Collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation

Explore deployment via mobile health apps and dashboards
